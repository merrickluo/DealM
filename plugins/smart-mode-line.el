;;; Commentary:

;; Smart Mode Line is a mode-line format that aims to be easy to
;; read from small to large monitors by using a prefix feature and
;; smart truncation.

;; Your mode-line will be color coded, smartly truncated (if you
;; want), easily customizable, and will have a few extra fancy
;; features like file path prefixes and minor mode filtering.

;;; Instructions:

;; INSTALLATION

;;	Make sure "smart-mode-line.el" is in your load path, then place
;; 	this code in your .emacs file:
;;		(require 'smart-mode-line)
;; 		(sml/setup)

;; DESCRIPTION

;;  Its main features are:

;; 		1) Color coded:
;; 			Highlights the most important information for you
;; 			(buffer name, modified state, line number).  Don't
;;			like the colors? See item 4)!

;; 		2) Fixed width (if you want):
;;			Lets you set a maxium width for the path name and mode
;;			names, and truncated intelligently (truncates the
;;			directory, not the buffer name).

;;		3) Fancy features:
;; 			Prefix feature saves a LOT of space.  e.g. "~/.emacs.d/"
;; 			is translated to ":ED:" in the path (open a file inside
;; 			this folder to see it in action). Long path names you
;; 			are commmonly working on are displayed as short
;; 			abbreviations.  Set your own prefixes to make best use
;; 			of it (by configuring `sml/replacer-regexp-list').  Mousing
;;			over the abbreviated path will show you the full
;;			path.  See below for examples.

;; 			Hidden-modes feature saves even more space.  Select
;; 			which minor modes you don't want to see listed by
;; 			customizing the `sml/hidden-modes' variable.  This will
;; 			filter out the modes you don't care about and unclutter
;; 			the modes list (mousing over the modes list still shows
;; 			the full list).

;; 		4) Very easy to configure:
;;			All fonts are in the `smart-mode-line-faces'
;;			customization group, and all other options are in
;;			`smart-mode-line'.  Just run `sml/customize' and see
;;			what's in there.  If you feel anything is missing send me
;;			an e-mail.

;; 		5) Compatible with `battery-display-mode':
;; 			Just turn the mode on to have the battery level
;; 			displayed. sml uses a very short syntax for the
;; 			battery. Only the battery level is displayed (with no %
;; 			symbol), and green/red font means charging/discharging
;; 			respectively.

;; Variables
;;
;; 	All variables can be edited by running `sml/customize', and the
;; 	documentations are mostly self explanatory, I list here only the
;; 	most important ones.

;; 	`sml/shorten-directory' and `sml/shorten-modes'
;; 		Setting both of these to t garantees a fixed width mode-line
;; 		(directory name and modes list will be truncated to fit).  To
;; 		actually define the width, see below.

;;	`sml/name-width' and `sml/mode-width'
;;		Customize these according to the width of your Emacs
;;		frame.  I set them to 40 and 30 respectively, and the
;;		mode-line fits perfectly when the frame is split in two even
;;		on my laptop's small 17" monitor.

;; 	`sml/replacer-regexp-list'
;; 		This variable is a list of (REGEXP REPLACEMENT) that is used
;; 		to parse the path.  The replacements are applied
;; 		sequentially.  This allows you to greatly abbreviate the path
;; 		that's shown in the mode-line.  If this abbreviation is of
;; 		the form ":SOMETHING:", it is considered a prefix and get's
;; 		a different color (you can change what's considered a prefix
;; 		by customizing `sml/prefix-regexp').

;;		For example, if you do a lot of work on a folder called
;;		"~/Dropbox/Projects/In-Development/" almost half the
;;		mode-line would be occupied just by the folder name, which
;;		is much less important than the buffer name.  But, you can't
;;		just hide the folder name, since editting a file in
;;		"~/Dropbox/Projects/In-Development/Source" is VERY different
;;		from editting a file in "~/Dropbox/Projects/Source".  By
;;		setting up a prefix for your commonly used folders, you get
;;		all that information without wasting all that space.  In this
;;		example you could set the replacement to ":ProjDev:" or just
;;		":InDev:", so the path shown in the mode-line will be
;;		":ProjDev:Source/" (saves a lot of space without hiding
;;		information).

;;		Here go some more useful examples:
;;
;; 	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^~/Dropbox/Projects/In-Development/"	":ProjDev:"))
;;	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^~/Documents/Work/"			":Work:))
;;
;;	;; Added in the right order, they even work sequentially:
;;	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^~/Dropbox/"				":DB:"))
;;	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^:DB:Documents"			":DDocs:"))
;;	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^~/Git-Projects/"			":Git:"))
;;	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^:Git:\\(.*\\)/src/main/java/"	":G/\\1/SMJ:"))
